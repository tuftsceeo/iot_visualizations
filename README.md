README for D3 Visualizations
	This project is a data visualization task that aims to demonstrate the
	links between different elements of an Internet of Things network. D3 is
	a data visualization tool that directly manipulates HTML elements like
	SVG (scalable vector graphics) in order to create visualizations. It is
	a JavaScript library that can be downloaded or included with
	this link: http://d3js.org/d3.v3.js.

	Useful examples to get started with:
		https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock

Software Needed to run:
	For files that require d3.json, a simple server must be run. For these
	purposes, python -m SimpleHTTPServer is adequate (type into command
	line in the directory that the file is in). Otherwise, the files are
	HTML files.
